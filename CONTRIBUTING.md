# Contributing to BeVec

We love your input! We want to make contributing to BeVec as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bevec.git
cd bevec
```

2. Install development dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e ".[test]"
```

3. Run tests:
```bash
pytest
```

4. Format code:
```bash
black .
isort .
```

5. Run type checks:
```bash
mypy .
```

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/yourusername/bevec/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/bevec/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
